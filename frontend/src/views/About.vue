                I got tired of trying to find info from 4+ sites on OMSCS classes so I came up with my own solution!
                It turns out that there's been some escapades in this area before and I certainly stand on the shoulders of 
                giants. Big shout out to my data sources.

                <p class="text-h4">So how did you get this data?</p>
                <p class="mb-5">
                    I did a combination of investigating the data structures of my data sources and some scraping.
                    The scraping is done at 10 minute intervals so if you don't see the data you want or need, 
                    refresh in 10 minutes and see if that helps.

                <p class="text-h4">I own one of those data sources and I'm mad ðŸ˜ </p>

                    I'm super sorry about that. Please contact me immediately and we'll work things out
                    until you're not mad anymore. <a href="mailto:hello@abigailhendrick.com">hello@abigailhendrick.com</a>
